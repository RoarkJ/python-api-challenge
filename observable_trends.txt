1.) Wind Speeds in both hemispheres were for the most part below 15mph.
2.) Cloudiness in both hemispheres did not follow a trend line at all.
3.) Northern hemisphere humidity levels were much higher than in southern hemisphere.
This makes sense because the seasons are opposite between the two hemispheres.
4.) The only trend lines that the data points had reasonable relationship to the
trend lines were the ones regarding max temp.
All others did not follow the trend line at any significant level.
